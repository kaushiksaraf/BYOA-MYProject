## Explore unique destinations



We understand the desire to explore the world beyond the typical tourist spots. Yatraverse offers a curated selection of destinations that are truly unique. Here are just a few examples:



### Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia



This otherworldly landscape was created by prehistoric lakes that have since evaporated, leaving a field of salt as far as the eye can see. Visitors can take a tour across the salt flats and even spend a night in a salt hotel.

This park is home to some of the most beautiful natural scenery in the world. The colorful pools of water and surrounding forests are a feast for the eyes, and visitors can take scenic hikes to truly appreciate the beauty.
